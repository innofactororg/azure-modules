# Innofactor Verified Solutions (IVS)

<img src="docs/static/img/ivs_logo.png" width=20% align=right>

**Welcome to the Innofactor Verified Solutions (IVS) repository!**

IVS is a self-hosted registry designed to complement **Azure Verified Modules (AVM)** by providing Innofactor-specific patterns, resources, and utilities for customized customer deliveries. IVS follows the same engineering and publishing standards as AVM, ensuring consistency and best practices while addressing scenarios where AVM does not fully meet our requirements.

Our goal is to provide:

- A structured approach to **customized IaC module development** aligned with AVM standards.
- **Consistent and well-tested** infrastructure-as-code solutions.
- **Extended functionality** where AVM modules lack specific features or have unresolved issues.
- **Patterns and reusable components** tailored to Innofactorâ€™s unique customer requirements.

For more information on IVS, **please visit the [innofactororg.github.io/azure-modules/](https://https://innofactororg.github.io/azure-modules/)**.

## IVS Mission Statement

Our mission is to deliver a comprehensive **Innofactor Verified Solutions** library, aligned with Microsoftâ€™s **Well-Architected Framework**, supporting multiple **IaC languages** (e.g., Bicep, Terraform). IVS serves as a trusted source of truth for **Innofactor customers**, accelerating Azure deployments and enabling **high-quality, consistent, and repeatable infrastructure** solutions.
