# Innofactor Verified Solutions (IVS) - Module Indexes

This repository contains module indexes used by the Innofactor Verified Solutions Continuous Integration (CI) environment. These indexes facilitate the publishing of new modules into the Innofactor Verified Solutions repository. The following module indexes are maintained in this repository:

- `pattern`
- `resource`

## Module Indexes

### Pattern Module Index

The `pattern` module index contains reusable patterns that can be leveraged to create new solutions efficiently. Each pattern is designed to address common use cases and is tested to ensure compliance with best practices.

### Resource Module Index

The `resource` module index provides individual Azure resources that can be deployed and configured independently. These resources are designed to be modular and reusable across various solutions, ensuring consistency and compliance.

### Utility Module Index

The `utility` module index includes helper scripts, utilities, and tools that assist in the deployment, management, and maintenance of Azure resources and solutions. These utilities are designed to improve productivity and streamline processes.
